# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: New Employee Creation

- **Breakpoint Location:** employeeService.ts, Line 18
- **Objective:** Investigate the creation of a new employee and ensure that the new employee object is correctly initialized and added to the `employees` array.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `employeeData`:
    '''javascript
    {
      branchId: 12,
      department: "Advisory",
      email: "<n.m@example.com>",
      name: "Naman",
      phone: "7896541232",
      position: "Doctor"
    }
    '''
  - `newEmployee`:
    '''javascript
    {
      id: 11,
      branchId: 12,
      department: "Advisory",
      email: "<n.m@example.com>",
      name: "Naman",
      phone: "7896541232",
      position: "Doctor"
    }
    '''

- **Call Stack:**
  - `createEmployee(employeeData)`: Calls `createEmployee` function with the given `employeeData`.

- **Behavior:**
  - When the breakpoint is hit, a new employee object is created with an ID calculated as `employees.length + 1`, and the `employeeData` is spread into this object.
  - The new employee object is then pushed into the `employees` array.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The `newEmployee` object is correctly initialized with the provided `employeeData`.
  - The ID of the new employee is correctly set to `employees.length + 1`, ensuring a unique ID for each new employee.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior? If so, what might be the cause?**
  - If the `employeeData` provided is incomplete or contains errors, the `newEmployee` object might not be created correctly. This can be observed in the variable states during debugging.

- **Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?**
  - Consider adding validation for the `employeeData` before creating the `newEmployee` object to ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted.
  - Add error handling to manage cases where the `employeeData` is invalid.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario helps understand the process of creating new employee records and how the system ensures unique IDs for each employee.
  - It also highlights the importance of input validation and error handling in maintaining data integrity.

## Scenario 2: Retrieving All Branches

- **Breakpoint Location:** branchService.ts, Line 28 (`return branches;`)
- **Objective:** Verify that all branch objects are correctly retrieved from the `branches` array.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `branches`: { id: 1, name: "Vancouver Branch", address: "1300 Burrard St, Vancouver, BC, V6Z 2C7", phone: "604-456-0022" },
  { id: 2, name: "Edmonton Branch", address: "7250 82 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB, T6B 0G4", phone: "780-468-6800" },
  { id: 3, name: "Arborg Branch", address: "317-A Fisher Road, Arborg, MB, R0C 0A0", phone: "204-555-3461" },
  { id: 4, name: "Regina Branch", address: "3085 Albert, Regina, SK, S4S 0B1", phone: "206-640-2877" },
  { id: 5, name: "Winnipeg Branch", address: "1 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB, R3B 2B9", phone: "204-988-2402" },
  { id: 6, name: "Steinbach Branch", address: "330 Main St, Steinbach, MB, R5G 1Z1", phone: "204-326-3495" },
  { id: 7, name: "Montréal Branch", address: "511 Rue Jean-Talon O, Montréal, QC, H3N 1R5", phone: "514-277-5511" },
  { id: 8, name: "Toronto Branch", address: "440 Queen St W, Toronto, ON, M5V 2A8", phone: "416-980-2500" },
  { id: 9, name: "Saint John Branch", address: "500 Fairville Blvd, Saint John, NB, E2M 5H7", phone: "506-632-0225" },
  { id: 10, name: "Headingley Branch", address: "500 McIntosh Rd, Headingley, MB, R4H 1B6", phone: "204-999-5555" },

- **Call Stack:**
  - `getAllBranches()`: Calls `getAllBranches` function to retrieve the list of all branches.

- **Behavior:**
  - When the breakpoint is hit, the function returns the `branches` array containing all branch objects.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The `branches` array correctly contains all the branch objects, and the function retrieves them as expected.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior? If so, what might be the cause?**
  - There were no unexpected behaviors observed. The function executed as expected, returning the complete list of branch objects.

- **Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?**
  - Currently, there are no immediate areas for improvement as the function is performing its intended task efficiently. However, you might consider adding caching mechanisms for large datasets to improve performance if the `branches` array grows significantly in size.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario helps understand how the system retrieves and handles branch data, ensuring that all branches are correctly managed and accessible.
  - It emphasizes the importance of maintaining an accurate and up-to-date list of branches for various operations within the project.

## Scenario 3: Filtering Employees by Department

- **Breakpoint Location:** employeeService.ts, Line 56 (`return employees.filter(employee => employee.department === department);`)
- **Objective:** Ensure that the correct employees are filtered and returned based on the provided department.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `department`: The department used for filtering employees.
  - `employees`: The state of the `employees` array before and after the filtering operation.
  - `filteredEmployees`: The array of employees that match the given department.

- **Call Stack:**
  - `getEmployeesByDepartment(department)`: Calls `getEmployeesByDepartment` function with the given department.

- **Behavior:**
  - When the breakpoint is hit, the `filter` method iterates over the `employees` array and returns an array of employees whose `department` property matches the provided department.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The `filter` method correctly identifies and returns the employees whose `department` property matches the provided department.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior? If so, what might be the cause?**
  - If no employees are returned, it indicates that there are no employees in the given department, or there might be a typo or case sensitivity issue in the department name provided.

- **Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?**
  - Consider implementing case-insensitive filtering to avoid issues with department name capitalization.
  - Add validation to ensure that the provided department name is valid and exists within the `employees` array.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario helps understand how the system filters and retrieves employee data based on department, ensuring that employees are correctly categorized and accessible.
